      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>For my Web Development class, I have to create a website. My mom knits a 
          lot and decided to make lovies for babies and sell them. She has been 
          successful and needs a website as the Facebook page she uses isn't enough 
          anymore. This is why I will make a website for people to be able to see her 
          work and have all the information needed to order them from her. Once my 
          project is done, I will translate the website to French so that she can 
          use it fully with her audience in Switzerland.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience for my website is either young parents, young grandparents, or people who 
          are looking for the perfect gift for a baby shower. The area is worldwide, because 
          the lovies can be easily shipped. But for this class, I will assume that 
          the target audience is people who live in the Rexburg area so that I 
          don't have to worry about shipping information for the duration of this 
          class. Rexburg is a good area for this product because the lovies are affordable 
          and there are a lot of young families.

        About Us: <br>
        Valérie Umiglia's passion has always been knitting. She has created many different things 
        in her life, like hats, sweaters, scarfs, or even blankets! In 2009, her son's half-sister 
        had just been born, and he wanted the perfect gift for the newest member in the family. He 
        didn't have much money, so he decided to ask her if there was anything that she could do for 
        him. Right then and there the idea was born for Val Doudous (in French, doudou means lovie). 
        Her project became more and more known in her friend group, as many people started to want to 
        buy them as gifts. In 2021, after over 10 years of refining her ideas for those lovies, 
        she decided to finally take a step forward and start actually putting more time 
        into it. She now offers over 70 different colors for those lovies. She loves creating those and 
        loves seeing the joy that those lovies bring to the families around her. <br>
