            <p>
            Valérie Umiglia's passion has always been knitting. She has created many different things 
            in her life, like hats, sweaters, scarfs, or even blankets! In 2009, her son's half-sister 
            had just been born, and he wanted the perfect gift for the newest member in the family. He 
            didn't have much money, so he decided to ask her if there was anything that she could do for 
            him. Right then and there the idea was born for Val Doudous (in French, doudou means lovie). 
            Her project became more and more known in her friend group, as many people started to want to 
            buy them as gifts. In 2021, after over 10 years of refining her ideas for those lovies, 
            she decided to finally take a step forward and start actually putting more time 
            into it. She now offers over 70 different colors for those lovies. She loves creating those and 
            loves seeing the joy that those lovies bring to the families around her.
