                Here are a few pictures and testimonials from some of our proud customers. If you would like 
                to share your review with us as well, feel free to send us a picture of your baby with 
                their doudou (blurred or hidden faces would be great) with a few words. You can send all of 
                this to our email: valdoudous@gmail.com

            Lucas can't sleep without his doudou. It is of great help when we have to travel with our little man.

            Our little Zachary got his doudou, and won't stop playing with it. He loves the knots for the 
            hands, that he bites constantly to relieve his teeth.

            Baby Emma is absolutely in love with her doudou! It definitely is one of her top 3 favorite toys.
